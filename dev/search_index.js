The initial state represents the inventory situation at the start of the simulation: what inventory is on hand, what inventory is in transit.

More than one initial state can be defined to represent potential different situations that have to be simulated or optimized. For example we could have several demand scenarios. In our example, we will create 10 such scenarios with different demand from the customer.
